           || CPM COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY 2017-2018 ||
This CPM program was made for students of Computational Biolgy 2017-2018

To run, cd into the directory of the program, and: 
>   make                        (only when you made changes to the code)
>   ./CPM
>   ./CPM -s 349                (let's try a different random seed)

Viewing the output:
Pictures of the simulation are stored in the directory "images". The
most recent image is displayed, but after you finished the simulation,
you can browse through all the images.

If the simulation is finished OR if you interupt the simulation, you
will be prompted to display plots showing statistics of both celltype
populations. 

Press 'q' with the window in focus to quit to program

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NOTE: if you run a new simulation, old data will be purged. Make sure
to make copies if you need the data.

Editing the parameters (no make needed)
>   gedit parfile.cfg

Editing the cellular dynamics (C++ code, don't forget to make)
>   gedit Celldynamics.cc

If you have a hard time with the program, look at this bear while 
waiting for help. Don't look directly into its eyes. :)
